MILLIONAIRE MIND ACTIONS Every time you catch yourself blaming, justifying, or complaining, slide your index finger across your neck, as a trigger to remind yourself that you are slitting your financial throat. Once again, even though this gesture may seem a little crude to do to yourself, it’s no more crude than what you’re doing to yourself by blaming, justifying, or complaining, and it will eventually work to alleviate these destructive habits. Do a “debrief.” At the end of each day, write down one thing that went well and one thing that didn’t. Then write the answer to the following question: “How did I create each of these situations?” If others were involved, ask yourself, “What was my part in creating each of these situations?” This exercise will keep you accountable for your life and make you aware of the strategies that are working for you and the strategies that are not.

Net worth Make these goals achievable with a realistic time frame, yet at the same time remember to “shoot for the stars.” Go to an upscale restaurant and order a meal at “market price” without asking how much it costs.

The number one reason most people don’t get what they want is that they don’t know what they want. Rich people are totally clear that they want wealth. They are unwavering in their desire. They are fully committed to creating wealth. As long as it’s legal, moral, and ethical, they will do whatever it takes to have wealth. Rich people do not send mixed messages to the universe.

MILLIONAIRE MIND ACTIONS Write a short paragraph on exactly why creating wealth is important to you. Be specific. Meet with a friend or family member who is willing to support you. Tell that person you want to evoke the power of commitment for the purpose of creating greater success. Put your hand on your heart, look that person in the eye, and repeat the following statement: “I, ____________ [your name], do hereby commit to becoming a millionaire or more by ________ [date].” Tell your partner to say, “I believe in you.” Then you say, “Thank you.” P.S. To strengthen your commitment, I invite you to commit directly to me at www.millionairemindbook.com, then print out your commitment and post it on your wall. P.P.S. Check in as to how you feel before your commitment and how you feel after it. If you feel a sense of freedom, you’re on your way. If you feel a tinge of fear, you’re on your way. If you didn’t bother doing it, you’re still in “not being willing to do whatever it takes” mode or “I don’t need to do any of this weird stuff” mode. Either way, let me remind you, your way has gotten you exactly where you are right now.

Open a separate bank account designated your Financial Freedom Account. Put 10 percent of every dollar you receive (after taxes) into this fund. This money is only to be used for investments and buying or creating passive-income streams. The job of this account is to build a golden goose that lays golden eggs called passive income. And when do you get to spend this money? Never! It is never spent—only invested. Eventually, when you retire, you get to spend the income from the fund (the eggs), but never the principal itself. In this way, it always keeps growing and you can never go broke.

This is the difference between positive thinking and power thinking. With positive thinking, people believe that their thoughts are true. Power thinking recognizes that our thoughts are not true, but since we’re making up a story anyway, we might as well make up a story that supports us. We don’t do this because our new thoughts are “true” in an absolute sense, but because they are more useful to us and feel a heck of a lot better than nonsupportive ones.

Make certain you do each of the exercises I suggested in the arenas of verbal programming, modeling, and specific incidents, in order to begin changing your blueprint to one that supports financial success. I also encourage you to do the declarations I suggested each and every day.

In Part II of this book, you learned seventeen specific ways that rich people think differently from poor and middle-class people. I recommend you commit each of these “wealth files” to memory by repeating their declarations daily. This will root these principles into your mind. Eventually you will find yourself looking at life and especially money very differently. From there you will make new choices and decisions and create new results. To speed up this process, make sure you do the action exercises given at the end of each of the wealth files.

The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.

Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy.

Once you’ve captured a batch of notes and it’s time to organize them, PARA comes into play. The four main categories are ordered by actionability to make the decision of where to put notes as easy as possible: Projects are most actionable because you’re working on them right now and with a concrete deadline in mind. Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable. Resources may become actionable depending on the situation. Archives remain inactive unless they are needed.

This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note, starting at the top of the list and moving down: In which project will this be most useful? If none: In which area will this be most useful? If none: Which resource does this belong to? If none: Place in archives. In other words, you are always trying to place a note or file not only where it will be useful, but where it will be useful the soonest.

Instead of organizing ideas according to where they come from, I recommend organizing them according to where they are going—specifically, the outcomes that they can help you realize. The true test of whether a piece of knowledge is valuable is not whether it is perfectly organized and neatly labeled, but whether it can have an impact on someone or something that matters to you.

The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for your future selfVII—by adding a highlight, a heading, some bullets, or commentary. This is the “campsite rule” applied to information—leave it better than you found it. This ensures that the notes you interact with most often will naturally become the most discoverable in a virtuous cycle.
